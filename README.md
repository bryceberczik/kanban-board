## Description
Kanban Board is a powerful and intuitive application designed to help you organize your tasks, manage your projects, and keep track of important information efficiently. Whether you're working on a personal project, collaborating with a team, or managing multiple workflows, Kanban Board provides a visual and interactive way to ensure you stay on top of your tasks and meet your deadlines.

With Kanban Board, you can create and customize boards to suit your specific needs. Each board can contain multiple columns representing different stages of your workflow, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." You can easily add, edit, and move tasks between columns using a simple user interface, allowing you to visualize your progress and prioritize your work effectively.
